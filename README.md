The Dynamics of Polarization: Four Phases of Attractor Collapse in Societies

Polarization is not simply ideological distance or partisan hostility—it is a four‑phase attractor‑collapse process driven by the spectral evolution of social‑influence networks. We present a unified dynamical framework in which individual drift, homophilic interaction, and network susceptibility jointly determine ideological trajectories. Three diagnostics—the dominant eigenvalue of the influence matrix (χ), a variance–divergence ratio (VDR⁻¹), and center density—capture the geometry and stability of attractor basins.
Applying this framework to the complete roll‑call history of the U.S. Congress (1789–2024; N=50,829 member‑terms), we identify a 91‑year polarization trajectory beginning with the New Deal. The diagnostics reveal a consistent sequence: dimensional compression, geometric sorting, dynamical tightening, and intra‑attractor fragmentation. This progression recovers canonical party‑system transitions without labels and explains the collapse of moderation: once χ exceeds a critical threshold χ_c, social forces overwhelm intrinsic drift, rendering autonomous moderation dynamically unstable.
Comparative analysis shows the same four‑phase sequence across revolutions, authoritarian consolidations, and digital communities, with timescales governed by network connectivity and coupling strength. These results suggest polarization is a predictable dynamical outcome of influence networks, offering a general mechanism for understanding democratic instability, factionalism, and ideological entrapment across diverse political systems.
